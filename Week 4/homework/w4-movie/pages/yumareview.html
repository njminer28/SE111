                <h2>REVIEW</h2>
                <p><strong>3:10 to Yuma</strong> directed by James Mangold, and starring Christian Bale, and my all time favorite actor
                    Russel Crowe, explores Mid-Western Arizona when outlaw Ben Wade (Crowe) is captured and must be taken to Yuma to meet
                    his fate. My all time favorite movie, Yuma is not for the fate of heart. </p>

                    <p>What makes <strong>3:10 to Yuma</strong> such an amazing watch is the action, acting and lawlessness that is portrayed.
                    Russel Crowe is such an amazing actor, he fits the role so perfectly. One scene that sticks with me the most is when Ben Wade shows
                    his true colors-- he had murdered a Pinkerton for keeping him awake by singing. Gruesome, but the looks on the surrounding band's faces
                    showed what they were getting into bringing Wade to his demise. Overall, I would rate this movie a 10/10. I truly have a bias here,
                    being a Western lover, but this movie is a great watch. </p>
