                <h2>REVIEW</h2>
                <p><strong>Brothers</strong> is a movie directed by Jim Sheridan, starring Tobey Maguire and Jake Gyllenhaal 
                    as two brothers who are torn apart by war. Sam, played by Maguire, is a U.S. Marine who lost overseas when captured
                by the Islamic forces. Tommy, played by Gyllenhaal, is his brother, who developes an emotional connection with Sam's wife,
                Grace, who is played by Natalie Portman. Sam eventually comes home and all hell breaks out. </p>

                <p>What makes <strong>Brothers</strong> such an amazing movie is the acting and plot. Every scene keeps you glued to the screen.
                It is very engaging to watch the emotional performace done by Maguire. What really fascinated me about this movie was how Maguire explored
                the topic of PTSD, and his weight loss journey to play his role as Sam. I would honestly give this movie a 10/10.</p>
