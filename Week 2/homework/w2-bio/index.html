    <h1 id="header">Nick Miner - About Me</h1>
    <h2 id="bio">Bio</h2>
    <p>My name is Nick. I'm currently studying Cybersecurity Defense at New England Insitute of Technology. 
        I am making this webpage for my HTML and JavaScript class. I grew up in New York, and have always been fascinated with computers. 
        My parents introduced me to computers when I was about 3 or 4 years old. Ever since I can't keep my eyes away from a screen. 
        Now that I'm older, I know computers are the future and I would love to make a career out of them. Especially in cyber analysis.</p>
